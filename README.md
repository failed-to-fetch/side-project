# Name to be Decided

A repository analysis app. Users sign in (email and password, GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket), connect a code host, and the backend pulls in repositories and analyses their history.

**Status:** sign-in works, and the backend can link a GitHub account for repo access. Repo listing, analysis jobs and most of the frontend are not built yet. See [Status](#status).

## How it fits together

Everything runs in Docker Compose. The browser only ever talks to one address, <http://localhost:3000>. Caddy (in the `frontend` container) serves the app and forwards API calls:

```
browser ──► localhost:3000 (Caddy)
              ├─ /api/auth/*  ──► auth      (sign-in, sessions)
              ├─ /api/*       ──► backend   (everything else)
              └─ anything else ──► the React app
```

Because it's all one origin, there's no CORS, and the session cookie is first-party.

| Service | What it does | Direct port (this machine only) |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend` | React app built with Vite, served by Caddy, which also routes `/api` | **3000** (the only public port) |
| `auth` | [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/docs) on Node. Owns users, sign-in and sessions | 3001 |
| `backend` | FastAPI (Python 3.12). Repo access and analysis. Checks sessions with `auth` | 8000 |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL 18, shared by `auth` and `backend` (each manages only its own tables) | 5432 |
| `redis` | Cache | 6379 |
| `auth-migrate`, `backend-migrate` | Apply database migrations on start, then exit | – |

The direct ports are bound to `127.0.0.1` for debugging, so other machines can't reach them.

Signing in sets a `better-auth.session_token` cookie. When the backend gets a request with that cookie, it asks `auth` who the user is and caches the answer for 60 seconds.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**
- **Docker** with Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not the older `docker-compose`): Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS, or Docker Engine plus the Compose plugin on Linux
- **A bash shell** for the scripts in `scripts/`. On Windows use **Git Bash** (installed with Git for Windows), not PowerShell
- **A GitHub account**, to create the OAuth App used for sign-in

You don't need Python, Node or uv installed. They run inside the containers.

## Getting started

Run everything from the project root, in Git Bash on Windows.

### 1. Clone

```sh
git clone git@github.com:failed-to-fetch/side-project.git
cd side-project
```

### 2. Create a GitHub OAuth App for sign-in

The auth service won't start without one. Each developer creates their own, because the callback URL points at `localhost`. Never share client secrets.

Go to <https://github.com/settings/applications/new> (Settings, Developer settings, OAuth Apps, New OAuth App):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Application name | anything, e.g. `yourname-side-project-dev` |
| Homepage URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Authorization callback URL | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` |

Click **Register application**, then **Generate a new client secret**. Keep the page open: you need the Client ID and the secret in the next step, and GitHub shows the secret only once.

### 3. Create your `.env`

```sh
scripts/setup.sh
```

This creates `.env` from `.env.example` and generates the secrets (`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`). Then it lists what you still need to fill in.

Open `.env` and set the two values from step 2:

```dotenv
GITHUB_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GITHUB_LOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

No quotes, no spaces around `=`. `.env` is git-ignored; never commit it. Back up `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: if it's lost, stored tokens can't be decrypted and users have to re-link GitHub.

### 4. Start everything

```sh
scripts/setup.sh --up
```

The first run builds all the images, which takes a few minutes. Migrations are applied automatically before the backend and auth service start.

### 5. Check it works

```sh
docker compose ps -a
```

`auth-migrate` and `backend-migrate` should show `Exited (0)`. Everything else should be `Up`, and `backend`, `postgres` and `redis` should be `(healthy)`.

Then open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in. The backend API docs are at <http://localhost:3000/api/docs>.

### 6. Run the checks

```sh
scripts/check.sh
```

This runs what CI runs: lint, a format check, a migration check and the backend tests. All should pass.

### Upgrading from an older checkout

If you set the project up before October 2026 and see `table "test_messages" does not exist`, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). In short:

```sh
git pull
scripts/setup.sh                 # adds any new .env values
docker compose up -d --build     # rebuilds images and re-runs migrations
```

**Update your GitHub callback URLs.** Everything is now served from port 3000 under `/api`:

| Registration | New callback URL |
|---|---|
| OAuth App (sign-in) | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` (was port 3001) |
| GitHub App (repo access), if you made one | `http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/github/callback` (was `localhost:8000/auth/github/callback`) |

## Everyday development

```sh
docker compose up -d                     # start (also applies new migrations)
docker compose down                      # stop; your data is kept
docker compose logs -f backend           # follow one service's logs
docker compose ps -a                     # what's running, and migrate results
```

What picks up your changes:

| You changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| Backend code (`backend/app`) | Nothing. The backend auto-reloads |
| A backend migration | `docker compose up -d` (or see [Database migrations](#database-migrations)) |
| Backend dependencies | `docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d` |
| Auth service code (`services/auth`) | `docker compose up -d --build auth` |
| Frontend code | `docker compose up -d --build frontend`, or run Vite with hot reload (below) |
| `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` | `docker compose up -d` (running containers don't re-read them) |

**Frontend with hot reload.** The `frontend` container serves a production build. For hot reload, keep the stack running and start Vite alongside it. Vite forwards `/api` to the stack on port 3000, and the auth service trusts Vite's origin. This needs Node 24 and pnpm locally (`mise install` in `frontend/` if you use mise):

```sh
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev     # then open http://localhost:5173
```

If Vite runs on a different port, add that origin to `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `.env` and run `docker compose up -d`.

### Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/setup.sh [--up]` | Creates `.env` and generates its secrets. Never overwrites values you've set. `--up` also starts everything |
| `scripts/check.sh [--fix]` | Lint, format check, migration check, backend tests. `--fix` applies formatting first |
| `scripts/new-migration.sh "msg"` | Generates an Alembic migration from model changes |
| `scripts/reset-db.sh` | Deletes the local database and starts fresh. Asks you to type `reset` first |

## Backend

The layout and how to add a feature are in [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md); the tests in [`backend/tests/README.md`](backend/tests/README.md). The tests run against your local database inside transactions that are rolled back, so they leave no data behind.

CI ([`.github/workflows/backend.yml`](.github/workflows/backend.yml)) runs the same checks as `scripts/check.sh` on every pull request that touches `backend/`, plus a migration downgrade and upgrade.

### Dependencies

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) manages them: `backend/pyproject.toml` lists them, and `backend/uv.lock` pins exact versions. Commit both together. Run uv inside the container:

```sh
docker compose run --rm backend uv add <package>          # runtime dependency
docker compose run --rm backend uv add --dev <package>    # test or lint tool only
docker compose run --rm backend uv lock --upgrade         # upgrade within the constraints
docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d
```

The backend image has two targets. Compose uses `dev` (with pytest and ruff, code bind-mounted). The default `prod` target has runtime dependencies only and runs as a non-root user.

## Database migrations

The backend's schema is managed with Alembic, and Better Auth's tables by its own migrations (`auth-migrate`). Alembic ignores Better Auth's tables. Never use `Base.metadata.create_all()`, and never use `alembic stamp head` to hide a problem.

`docker compose up` applies pending migrations automatically. To run Alembic yourself:

```sh
docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head    # apply
docker compose run --rm backend alembic current         # should end in "(head)"
docker compose run --rm backend alembic history
docker compose run --rm backend alembic downgrade -1    # roll back one; can destroy data
```

### Create a migration

1. Change or add the model in its feature folder (e.g. `backend/app/features/integrations/models.py`). A **new** model must also be imported in `backend/app/models.py`, or Alembic won't see it.
2. Generate the migration:
   ```sh
   scripts/new-migration.sh "describe the change"
   ```
3. **Read the new file** in `backend/alembic/versions/` before applying it. Check every `drop_table` and `drop_column`. Autogenerate also misses renames and data changes, and can misread expression indexes (such as one on `lower(email)`).
4. Apply it with `docker compose up -d`, and run `scripts/check.sh`.
5. Commit the migration together with the model change.

### Reset or change the database

`scripts/reset-db.sh` deletes all local data (users, sessions, linked accounts) and starts fresh. Use it only on a development machine, and never to work around a broken migration on data you care about.

Postgres only reads `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` when its volume is first created. To change the password and keep your data, set the new value in `.env`, then:

```sh
docker compose exec postgres psql -U app -d appdb -c "ALTER USER app PASSWORD 'the-new-password'"
docker compose up -d
```

## GitHub App for repo access (optional)

This is separate from the OAuth App used for sign-in. A GitHub **App** lets the backend read a user's repositories. Without one, everything else works and linking returns 503.

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/apps/new> and fill in:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | GitHub App name | anything unique, e.g. `yourname-side-project-dev` |
   | Homepage URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
   | Callback URL | `http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/github/callback` |
   | Expire user authorization tokens | ticked |
   | Webhook, Active | unticked |
   | Repository permissions | Contents: Read-only, Metadata: Read-only |
   | Where can this GitHub App be installed | Only on this account |

2. Click **Create GitHub App**. Copy the **Client ID** (starts with `Iv`, not the numeric App ID), then **Generate a new client secret**.
3. Add both to `.env` as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, then run `docker compose up -d`.
4. Sign in at <http://localhost:3000>, then open <http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/github/link> in the same browser. You should land on `/settings?linked=github`.

If it fails, the redirect ends in `?error=<reason>`:

| Reason | Fix |
|---|---|
| `github_error` | Wrong client secret, or the callback URL isn't exactly `http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/github/callback` |
| `already_linked` | That GitHub account is linked to a different user |
| `invalid_state`, `expired_state` | Took over 10 minutes, or the cookie was lost. Start again in the same browser |
| `github_denied` | You cancelled on GitHub |

## API overview

All paths are on the public address (<http://localhost:3000> locally).

Sign-in, sign-out and sessions: the auth service at `/api/auth/*` ([Better Auth API](https://www.better-auth.com/docs)). The frontend uses it through `authClient` in `frontend/src/lib/auth-client.ts`.

Backend (interactive docs at `/api/docs`):

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | none | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| `GET /api/users/me` | session | current user: `{id, email, name}` |
| `GET /api/integrations/github/link` | session | start linking GitHub for repo access |
| `GET /api/integrations/github/callback` | none | GitHub redirects here |
| `DELETE /api/integrations/github` | session | unlink GitHub (204; 404 if not linked) |

From the frontend, call the backend with relative URLs such as `fetch("/api/users/me")`. The session cookie is sent automatically.

Errors use `{"detail": ...}`. 401 means no valid session; 503 means the auth service is unreachable. A sign-out can take up to 60 seconds to reach the backend because of the session cache.

## Running on a server or VM

The same compose file runs on a Linux VM for testing. Everything is reached through one port, and only that port is exposed.

1. On the VM, install Git and Docker (Engine plus the Compose plugin), clone the repo, and run `scripts/setup.sh`.
2. In the VM's `.env`, set the address you'll open in the browser:
   ```dotenv
   PUBLIC_URL=http://203.0.113.10:3000      # your VM's IP or hostname
   ```
   To serve on port 80 instead, also set `FRONTEND_PORT=80` and drop `:3000` from `PUBLIC_URL`.
3. **Register callback URLs for that address.** A GitHub OAuth App has only one callback URL, so create a second OAuth App for the VM with `<PUBLIC_URL>/api/auth/callback/github`, and put its ID and secret in the VM's `.env`. A GitHub App accepts several callback URLs, so you can add `<PUBLIC_URL>/api/integrations/github/callback` to your existing one.
4. Allow the port in your cloud provider's firewall or security group (inbound TCP 3000, or 80).
5. Start it with `scripts/setup.sh --up`.

Check from **your own machine**:

```sh
curl http://203.0.113.10:3000/api/health          # {"status":"ok"}
curl -m 5 http://203.0.113.10:8000/api/health     # must time out or be refused
```

Postgres (5432), Redis (6379), the backend (8000) and auth (3001) are bound to `127.0.0.1` on the VM and must not be reachable from outside. This matters because Docker's published ports bypass `ufw` on Linux, so a host firewall alone doesn't protect them.

### HTTPS

Caddy can get a free Let's Encrypt certificate by itself, as long as it has a hostname that points at the VM. If you don't have a domain, [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) provides one: `79-72-88-229.sslip.io` resolves to `79.72.88.229`. Replace the dashes with your IP's numbers.

1. In the VM's `.env`:
   ```dotenv
   SITE_ADDRESS=79-72-88-229.sslip.io
   PUBLIC_URL=https://79-72-88-229.sslip.io
   COOKIE_SECURE=true
   FRONTEND_PORT=80
   HTTPS_PORT=443
   ```
2. In the cloud firewall, allow inbound **TCP 80 and 443**. Port 80 must be open to the whole internet while the certificate is issued and renewed, because Let's Encrypt connects to it to verify the domain. Caddy also uses it to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
3. Update both GitHub callback URLs to `https://79-72-88-229.sslip.io/api/...`.
4. `docker compose up -d`, then follow `docker compose logs -f frontend` until you see `certificate obtained successfully` (usually within a minute).

Certificates are kept in the `caddy-data` volume and renewed automatically. If issuance fails, the logs say why. Usually port 80 isn't reachable from the internet, or the hostname doesn't resolve to this VM.

**Limits.** This is still the development setup: the backend runs with auto-reload from a bind mount and the dev image. That's fine for testing on a VM, but it isn't production-ready.

## Troubleshooting

Start with `docker compose ps -a` and `docker compose logs <service> --tail 60`.

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `table "test_messages" does not exist` while migrating | Old migrations (before October 2026) tried to drop a table that a fresh database never had. Pull the latest code, which fixes them, then `docker compose up -d --build`. If your database is still stuck, `scripts/reset-db.sh` |
| `service "auth-migrate" didn't complete successfully`; `auth`, `backend` and `frontend` stay `Created` | A required `.env` value is empty. `docker compose logs auth-migrate` names it, usually `GITHUB_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID` or `GITHUB_LOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET`. Fill it in, then `docker compose up -d` |
| `backend-migrate` shows `Exited (1)` | A migration failed: `docker compose logs backend-migrate` |
| Backend logs `validation error for Settings` | A `.env` value is missing or malformed; the error names it. Run `scripts/setup.sh`, then `docker compose up -d` |
| `password authentication failed for user "app"` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env` doesn't match the one the database was created with. See [Reset or change the database](#reset-or-change-the-database) |
| `{"detail":"Authentication service unavailable."}` | `auth` is down: `docker compose logs auth --tail 60` |
| `{"detail":"GitHub is not configured."}` | The optional repo-access GitHub App isn't set up. See [GitHub App for repo access](#github-app-for-repo-access-optional) |
| `relation "..." does not exist` | Migrations didn't run: `docker compose up -d`, then check `backend-migrate` |
| `Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated` | Something else uses that port. Stop it, or set `FRONTEND_PORT` (and `PUBLIC_URL` to match) in `.env` |
| Sign-in fails with 403 `Invalid origin` | The page's origin isn't trusted: it must be `PUBLIC_URL` or listed in `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` |
| GitHub says `redirect_uri is not associated with this application` | The callback URL in your GitHub settings doesn't match `PUBLIC_URL` (see [Upgrading](#upgrading-from-an-older-checkout)) |
| `502 Bad Gateway` on `/api/...` | Caddy can't reach `auth` or `backend`: check `docker compose ps -a` and their logs |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` in the backend | The image is older than `uv.lock`: `docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d` |
| A script fails with `$'\r': command not found` | It was checked out with Windows line endings. Run `git rm --cached -r -q . && git reset --hard` (commit your work first) |
| A `.env` change has no effect | Running containers don't re-read it: `docker compose up -d` |
